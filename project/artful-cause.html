                        <h3>The problem</h3>
                        <p>Considering that many fellow designers wish to contribute to society and assist
                            non-profitorganizations with their skills, but often struggle to find relevant information.
                            On the other hand, non-profit organizations face budget constraints, resulting in limited
                            resources to produce high-quality projects.Therefore, this platform has been created to
                            facilitate the connection betweenboth parties and allow like-minded designers to find more
                            fellow enthusiasts.</p>

                            <li>The platform should be able towork on mobile app and responsive website.</li>

                            <li>Volunteers should be able to edittheir profile freely.</li>

                        <h2>Understanding the user</h2>
                        <p>During the user research phase, we conducted interviews with a diverse group of individuals
                            to gather insights and understand their needs, motivations, and frustrations. We engaged
                            with a range of users togain a holistic understanding of their experiences and perspectives.
                            Through these interviews, we explored topics such as their motivations for non-profit work,
                            previous involvement in charitable initiatives, challenges in connectingwith organizations,
                            and their expectations for a platform like ours. Theempathy maps provided valuable insights
                            into their thoughts, feelings, andgoals, helping us develop personas that captured their
                            unique characteristics and needs.</p>
                        <p>Additionally,we conducted a competitive audit, examining platforms that match talents and
                            volunteers to projects, to identify their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities. This
                            research laid a strong foundation for our platform's design and development, enabling us to
                            create a user-centered experience that catersto the needs of both artists and non-profit
                            organizations.</p>

                            from previous projects, and a gallery of joinedprojects. Additionally, I have prioritized
                            easy access to the contact information, understanding its importance in connecting users
                            with volunteers. As this is a preview page, the edit function takes precedence over contact
                            information, and an edit button remains visible on the top bar as users scroll for
                            convenient access. To enhance usability, I have separated the editing function into two
                            parts: profile and project. This separation allows users toedit their profile and project
                            information from different access points in thefuture. When users want to edit their project
                            content, they can enter adedicated section that enables them to reorder, delete, and add
                            images.</p>

                                <p>Currently, when users wants to edit project content, they need to enter a new
                                    section.
                                    This user flow should be able to me more simple and seamless.</p>

                                <p>In the usability study, I noticed that it can be simpler to let users edit project
                                    contents directly on the edit project page, instead of going to the edit section by
                                    click on a button.</p>

                        <p>Participants are looking forward to have a place to contribute their talents. Espeacially for
                            those who are introverted, it is a challenge to go out and meet people. The platform create

                        <p>It is a new lesson that although I was designing for the same platform, the outcome would be
                            different according to what divece users are using. In addition, the purpose of dedicated
                            app might be different from its mobile website.

                            We have to explore more of our users thoughts, to make the most friendliestdesign.</p>
