                        <p>Our objective is to create a nutrition calculator that allows users to access thenutritional
                            information. Additionally, once they have finished making theirselection, they should be

                        <h2>Understanding the user</h2>
                        <p>With the goal of assisting my friend's entrepreneurial endeavor in the restaurant industry, I
                            took on the task of designing a responsive website for Roli Burrito. To ensure that the
                            website catered to the needs of potential customers, I conducted extensive user research.
                            This involved interviewing my friend to gain insights from a client's perspective and also
                            reaching out to individuals in my network who had experience with online ordering. By
                            gathering valuable feedback and insights from these interviews, I was able to incorporate
                            user preferences and expectations into the website's design and functionality. The result is
                            a user-friendly platform that effectively showcases Roli Burrito's offerings and provides a
                            seamless online ordering experience.</p>

                                <p>The initial step of the checkout flow, which is finding a nearby Roli, often confuses
                                    users as it doesn't appear to be the starting point of the checkout process. To
                                    address this issue, I have implemented a checkout flow map that clearly indicates
                                    the section users are currently in, providing them with a better understanding of
                                    the overall process.</p>

                                    incorporate these crucial pieces of information. Now, users can easily access the
                                    open hours and contact information, ensuring a more informative and user-friendly

                            These enhancements aim to address any usability issuesand refine the overall user

                        <h3>Impact</h3>
                        <p>Feedback on the hi-fi prototype revealed that the design was intuitive and easy to navigate,
                            while the order function was particularly straightforward and understandable.</p>
                        <h3>What I learned</h3>
                        <p>Every time I conduct a usability study, I receive valuable feedback that not only refreshes
                            my thoughts but also highlights the interesting fact that everyone thinks differently. This
                            realization has helped me become more receptive to advice and maintain an open-minded
                            approach to design.</p>
                        <h3>Next steps</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Conduct follow-up usability test on the website.</li>
                            <li>Identify any additional areas of need and ideate on new features.</li>
