                        <h3>The background</h3>
                        <p>Georifters is a console game which players use controllers to explore the UI. My
                            responsibilities encompassed lighting, environment concept, UI, UX design, and video making.
                        </p>

                    <article id="ideate">
                        <h2>Ideate</h2>
                        <p>The 2D team started from UI design at first, then gradually join the UX design process.</p>
                    </article>
                    <article id="design">
                        <h2>UI/UX Design</h2>
                        <h3>The Goals</h3>
                        <p>The art design team was not involved in the initial UX research but received a prototype that
                            resembled a Sitemap. Therefore, in addition to the UI design, we were also designing the UX
                            of the page.</p>
                        <p>Here are some goals that we were aiming to achieve on UI/UX.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use elements from the 80s.</li>
                            <li>Control the performance of UI.</li>
                            <li>Preseve the extension of future updates and DLC</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>The Challenges</h3>
                        <p>When designing the layout, we encountered some challenges:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The limited amount of buttons on a controller.</li>
                            <li>Need to match the way how a controller works on UI.</li>
                            <li>The UI needs to preserve the extension of future updates and DLC.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
                        <p>When discussing the art style, we chose the relatively easy-to-produce 2D comic style due to
                            the ease of production and time cost.</p>
                        <img src="../img/prj/01_Georifters/Georifters game_style exploration.webp"
                            alt="style exploration in brainstorm stage">
                        <p>Once we had decided on the style direction, we standardized the typeface, colors, and
                            materials.</p>
                        <img src="../img/prj/01_Georifters/Georifters game_design decision.webp" alt="design document">
                        <h3>Mockup</h3>
                        <p>We would provide engineers with a Techboard that includes the size specifications. In
                            addition, we would also create a demonstration video so that engineers can understand the
                            effect we want to achieve.</p>

                        <h3>Prototype</h3>
                        <p>Once the engineers have added the UI, the team members would start to try it out and test it.
                            We would put our feedback in JIRA, an agile development software. 2D team would review these
                            feedbacks, evaluate the problem, and make adjustments.</p>
                        <h3>Usability Study</h3>
                        <p>Besides usual internal tests, the company also arranged several usability studies with
                            external personnel. After the studies, we would ask participants to fill out questionnaires.
                            The question included the overall experience, the difficulty of operation, and UI/UX
                            feedback. The results would be added to JIRA.</p>
                        <p>There were many findings from these usability sutdies. For example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There should be an instruction page, so players could review the rules whenever they
                                want.</li>
                            <li>Players should be able to learn the information of the character ability of each
                                characters.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Refine the Design</h3>
                        <p>Take Character Selection page in team up mode as an example. Players now can press Y button
                            to check the character abiliy of their chosen character. Furthermore, we adjust the scale
                            and porpotion of each elements, to help users focus on the character area.</p>

                            <p>Beside the UI/UX, I also participated in other prats of the production. Here are some
                                demonstration of them.</p>
                            <h3>Visual Design</h3>
                            <p>The 2D team had all worked on enviroment, characters, and props design.</p>
                            <p>The enviroment design start at the very early stage of the development. We were exploring
                                the story at the same time. Fortunately, the idea of candy world had been selected as
                                one of the main theme, and become the main character - Candy's hometown.</p>

                            <h2>takeaways</h2>
                            <p>Designing for a console game is an exceptional opportunity that presents a multitude of
                                unique challenges and invaluable learning experiences. In addition to the fundamental
                                principles of user experience (UX) design, we are faced with overcoming the limitations
                                imposed by controllers and ensuring optimal performance. Yet, despite the negotiations
                                and necessary compromises, it is truly inspiring to witness the triumph over these
                                obstacles and create a remarkable masterpiece.</p>
                            <p>This experience holds great value, as it prepares me to tackle unforeseen problems that
                                may arise in future design projects. It instills in me the confidence to face any
                                obstacles or restrictions head-on, knowing that exceptional achievements are still
                                within reach. The lessons learned from designing for console games have strengthened my
                                resolve and equipped me with the resilience to overcome any challenge that comes my way.
