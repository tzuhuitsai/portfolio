                        <p>In addition to leveraging our own experience using multiple freelance platforms, we conducted
                            research on various platforms in the market to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of their
                            interface and user flow. Our goal was to make our platform more exceptional.</p>

                            <li>We followed hierarchy principles in organizing the content of the text.</li>

                        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                        <h3>Impact</h3>
                        <p>With the conclusion of the project, the UI/UX design phase has come to an end. The subsequent
                            development will be carried out by the client.</p>
                        <h3>What I learned</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Through the use of the Material Design system in this project, I gained a deeper
                                understanding of its principles. In future web design projects, I aim to apply this
                                system more effectively and efficiently, ensuring visual consistency and readability.
                            </li>
                            <li> I developed a habit of preserving versions at each stage of the design process. While
                                using components to handle recurring elements facilitated efficiency, it posed
                                challenges when working with components that span multiple pages. With increased
                                proficiency in Figma, I have gained new insights on preserving versions. I aim to
                                document these insights as a standard operating procedure (SOP) for future projects.
                            </li>
                            <li>Different devices and platforms (Android, iOS, mobile, desktop) present variations in
                                how websites are displayed, such as the location of the URL bar or the shrinking of the
                                toolbar. Therefore, in addition to mastering different screen sizes, it is crucial to
                                consider the screen space available after accounting for these elements.</li>
                            <li>During the design process, even for features yet to be developed, I proactively included
                                them in the design if I believed they would be beneficial for the platform, leaving room
                                for their implementation. This approach eliminates the need for redesigning the
                                interface when such features are developed.</li>
