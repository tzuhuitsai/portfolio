                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <h3>The problem</h3>
                <p>Considering that many fellow designers wish to contribute to society and assist
                    non-profitorganizations with their skills, but often struggle to find relevant information. On the
                    other hand, non-profit organizations face budget constraints, resulting in limited resources to
                    produce high-quality projects.Therefore, this platform has been created to facilitate the connection
                    betweenboth parties and allow like-minded designers to find more fellow enthusiasts.</p>
                <h3>The goals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The platform should be able towork on mobile app and responsive website.</li>
                    <li>The platform should provide auser profile pages for volunteers to showcase their work and
                        experiences.</li>
                    <li>Volunteers should be able to edittheir profile freely.</li>

                <h2>Understanding the user</h2>
                <p>During the user research phase, we conducted interviews with a diverse group of individuals to gather
                    insights and understand their needs, motivations, and frustrations. We engaged with a range of users
                    togain a holistic understanding of their experiences and perspectives. Through these interviews, we
                    explored topics such as their motivations for non-profit work, previous involvement in charitable
                    initiatives, challenges in connectingwith organizations, and their expectations for a platform like
                    ours. Theempathy maps provided valuable insights into their thoughts, feelings, andgoals, helping us
                    develop personas that captured their unique characteristics and needs.<br>
                    Additionally,we conducted a competitive audit, examining platforms that match talents and volunteers
                    to projects, to identify their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities. This research laid a strong
                    foundation for our platform's design and development, enabling us to create a user-centered
                    experience that catersto the needs of both artists and non-profit organizations.</p>

                <p>The low-fidelity prototype demonstrates the user's journey in previewing andediting their profile.
                    The profile page showcases the user's skills, interests in various causes, reviews from previous
                    projects, and a gallery of joinedprojects. Additionally, I have prioritized easy access to the
                    contact information, understanding its importance in connecting users with volunteers. As this is a
                    preview page, the edit function takes precedence over contact information, and an edit button
                    remains visible on the top bar as users scroll for convenient access. To enhance usability, I have
                    separated the editing function into two parts: profile and project. This separation allows users
                    toedit their profile and project information from different access points in thefuture. When users
                    want to edit their project content, they can enter adedicated section that enables them to reorder,
                    delete, and add images.</p>

                <h2>Going forward</h2>
                <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                <h4>Impact</h4>
                <p>Participants are looking forward to have a place to contribute their talents. Espeacially for those
                    who are introverted, it is a challenge to go out and meet people. The platform create a save
                    environment for them to contribute to the society.</p>
                <h4>What I learned</h4>
                <p>It is a new lesson that although I was designing for the same platform, the outcome would be
                    different according to what divece users are using. In addition, the purpose of dedicated app might
                    be different from its mobile website.
                    <br>
                    We have to explore more of our users thoughts, to make the most friendliestdesign.
